"Follow the CRISP-DM method for, preparing, analyzing, model and visualizing data and answering three business related questions. Create a blog post to share your insights to a non-technincal audience."

## Business questions:

What are the most popular areas of Dublin versus the least popular?
How does pricing fluctuate over the seasonal periods?
How Neighbourhood Analysis help us to find good accomdation?


## Summary
The analysis was strictly based on quantitative features in the dataset i.e. possibly excluding a lot of important features. I only compared most popular areas of Dublin versus the least popular &  pricing fluctuate over the seasonal periods with Neighbourhood Analysis
I found that features regarding pricing fluctuate is very important in explaining the price. I also concluded that in order to get better results using the algorithms Linear Regression and Random Forest I should have put in more features.
